1. Use “Would you be open to” instead of “Can you” when you want to seem less commanding but still lead to a “yes.”
2. Add “because” to your reasoning or request to strengthen it.
3. Use “can we” instead of “can you” to be more collaborative, particularly in code reviews.
4. Use “What do you think” to assert a suggestion but still leave it open for discussion.
5. Use “It seems like” when the conversation is at a stalemate and you want to call it out directly. Many times this breaks the stalemate.
6. Change the order of your “but” to negate the part you actually want to negate.
