- The try/finally compound statement lets you run cleanup code
regardless of whether exceptions were raised in the try block.
- The else block helps you minimize the amount of code in try blocks
and visually distinguish the success case from the try/except
blocks.
- An else block can be used to perform additional actions after a successful
try block but before common cleanup in a finally block.
