sudo docker logs -f container_id 2>&1 | grep -e "DEBUG"

- `sudo`: This is used to execute the Docker command with elevated privileges.
- `docker logs -f container_id`: This part of the command fetches and follows the logs of the Docker container with the specified container ID. The `-f` flag stands for "follow," meaning it will continuously stream the logs as new entries are added.
- `2>&1`: This is used to redirect the standard error (stderr) to the same location as the standard output (stdout). This ensures that both stdout and stderr are captured by the `grep` command.
- `|`: This is a pipe symbol, and it is used to take the output of the previous command and pass it as input to the next command.
- `grep -e "DEBUG"`: This part of the command filters the log entries to only include lines that contain the term "DEBUG." The `-e` option is used to specify the pattern to match.

So, the overall command is effectively saying, "Show me the logs of the specified Docker container, follow them in real-time, and only display lines that contain the term 'DEBUG'."
